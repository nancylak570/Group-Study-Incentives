# Group Study Incentives

## Project Description
The Group Study Incentives project is a blockchain-based solution that encourages group study participation by rewarding participants with cryptocurrency. The system is implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, where administrators can create study sessions with specific topics and allocate rewards. Participants join these sessions, and upon successful completion, rewards are distributed among them. This decentralized approach ensures transparency, fairness, and security in the reward mechanism.
